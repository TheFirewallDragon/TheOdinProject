<h1>The Odin Project</h1>
<p> <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> is a remarkable, self-directed curriculum comprising top-notch online programming resources! This proved to be an indispensable asset in my journey toward becoming a software developer. Prior to discovering The Odin Project, I lacked clear direction in my learning, navigating through various topics and attempting to connect the pieces on my own.</p>
I have completed the following courses:
